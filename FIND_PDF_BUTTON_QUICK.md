## 📍 Exact Location

```
Top Navigation:
[🏠 Home]  [📦 Inventory & Stock]  [💰 Sales & Revenue] ← Click here

Then in the table:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Date | Medicine | Qty | Revenue | Sold By | Action  │
│      |          |     |         |         | [Button]│ ← Here!
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ❌ If Sales Tab is Empty

You'll see a message:
```
📭
No Sales Yet

Dispense medicine from the Inventory tab to see sales here

💡 Tip: Go to Inventory → Dispense Medicine → 
Come back here to see the 🖨️ Receipt button
```

This means: **You haven't made any sales yet!**

Go back to Inventory and dispense something first.

## ✅ When You Have Sales

You'll see a table with rows, and each row has a **purple button** that says:
```
🖨️ Receipt
```

Click it = PDF downloads instantly!

---

**That's it!** The button is there, you just need to make a sale first. 🚀
